# All notes from queries-factforge.txt also apply. 

# NB1: I assumed liberal use of "label", so I asked
#    ("Slayer" "creator of" ?x)
#    instead of
#    (?p "has name" "Slayer") (?p "creator of" ?x)

# Everywhere:
# - "creator of" is synonmym of "created"
# - any (?x "created" ?y) could be replaced by (?y "created by" ?x)

# All of this made me realise that we're only solving part of the
# problem, namely finding the right URI's for instances, classes,
# properties. But users also don't know the modelling choices that have
# been made (e.g. the one above about "are names of people modelled as
# labels or as "has name" properties?)
